CSCE 121H - Fall 2019
Project 3 - Vending Machine
due: Fri, 10/4/19, 8:00am

Write a simulation of a vending machine.  This will be an interactive
program, where the user will enter commands on the console.  For
example, the user could enter several coins, and then select an item by
saying 'press', like this:

  > vending
  quarter       // user input
  balance: 0.25 // response printed out

  nickel        // input
  balance: 0.30 // response

  quarter quarter dime // put in several coins on one line
  balance: 0.90 

  press coke
