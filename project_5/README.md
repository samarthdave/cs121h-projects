# Project 5 Important Information
Please use the tb.fasta and tb.prot_table file
or use your own. I only tested on those 2 files but fingers crossed...

Also, I hesitate to commit files that big but I might need them for future reference.

> Also also, I'd be amiss if I didn't mention that I made a commit really early into the morning (does 2am count as late?). Maybe this was a wake up call...literally. Made me sleep 10 hours straight though.

#### How to run
1. make
2. ./genomics (with 1 2 or 3 inputs)
- ex: ./genomics text.fasta text2.prot_table text3

#### Project5.txt contents
The objective of this assignment is to write a C++ program for
analyzing the genome of bacterial organisms.  Example files, included
the genome sequence (*.fasta) and annotation (*.prot_table) will be
provided on the course web page...
