### due: Fri Oct 18, 8:00am
---------------------

This is an "easier" lab (it's all relative but it took me longer
than it should have) for TAMU Datathon weekend (due Monday after)
and before midterm 1. :/

Takes in a "*.dat" file and returns relevant info about the cities
(proximity, furthest, distances between 2, etc.) using [trigonometric estimates](https://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/haversine/).

#### Project6.txt contents
he objective of this assignment is to write a C++ program for
calculating distances among cities in Texas given their
latitude/longitude coordinates...
