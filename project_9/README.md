# Project 9
I didn't think this project warranted it's own README
but it's reached the complexity where it seems like it should.

I've written too many comments to compensate for unreadable code
or bad design choices. Either way, I think an overhaul of the
design is warranted but who has the time for that.

Anyways, here's a new feature I added:
- creating & writing to a csv file for export
  - I think this will be harder than I think whoops
